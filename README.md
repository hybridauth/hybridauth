Hybridauth enables developers to easily build social applications and tools to engage websites visitors and customers on a social level that starts off with social sign-in and extends to social sharing, users profiles, friends lists, activities streams, status updates and more.

The main goal of Hybridauth is to act as an abstract API between your application and the various social networks APIs and identities providers such as Facebook, Twitter and Google.

#### Usage

Hybridauth provides a number of basic [examples](https://github.com/hybridauth/hybridauth/tree/master/examples). You can also find complete Hybridauth documentation at https://hybridauth.github.io

```php
$config = [
    'callback' => 'https://example.com/path/to/script.php',
    'keys' => [
        'key' => 'your-twitter-consumer-key',
        'secret' => 'your-twitter-consumer-secret',
    ],
];

try {
    $twitter = new Hybridauth\Provider\Twitter($config);

    $twitter->authenticate();

    $accessToken = $twitter->getAccessToken();
    $userProfile = $twitter->getUserProfile();
    $apiResponse = $twitter->apiRequest('statuses/home_timeline.json');
}
catch (\Exception $e) {
    echo 'Oops, we ran into an issue! ' . $e->getMessage();
}
```
